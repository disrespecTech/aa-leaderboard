Project is archived because it is possible to programmatically export the sheet without needing to authenticate with the Google API, 
which means [FolderBot](https://github.com/DesktopFolder/FolderBot) can just pull from the leaderboard directly.

# AA Leaderboard Data

Top 100 of the 1.16 Verifiable RSG AA Leaderboard is parsed and formatted into a JSON file and dumped in to this repository.  

The data here is intended to be read by [FolderBot](https://github.com/DesktopFolder/FolderBot) so users can query the leaderboard in Twitch chat.
